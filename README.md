# myTimeRelearningPython
I am a Junior at the University of Alabama studying Metallurgical Engineering but I want to branch more into my passion of computers. After not coding since highschool, I have decided to jump back into it during this quarentine for COVID-19, starting with Python. This is my code while I am relearning the basics.
Some of the starting code is sloppy and unorganized. I promis my future projects will be much better.
